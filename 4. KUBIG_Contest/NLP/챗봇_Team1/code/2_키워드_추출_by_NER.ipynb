affect negatively. put instantly felt nauseous developed headache. im even trying dramatic im genuinely shocked instant negative impact me. reading previous review band aid description spot opinion. scent might briefly appreciate older woman wearing walked past store time spent perfume much me. scrub off. opening harsh pungent antiseptic like iodyne. drydown mostly whole lot nothing rare pleasant hint musky creaminess. also get negative comparisons. cat pee bad breath cold sweat. get sweetness. encounter older lady horrific mouth odor wearing learn hate going remind eternally. unfortunately plenty people demographic adopted signature scent . emperor new clothes kind story me. hype train went kept rolling enough people likely nudged gaslit forcing like it. eveyone said everything leaving much else say aside this. formulation thus discovered far mass defiled it. come bandwagon trodding along like sad merchant carriage. incredibly obvious past year people coveted say give false sense belonging people right want something unique groundbreaking one else posse sheep cut dry. yearn someone else desire trickle causing chain reaction infectious. observed individual must must mentality watching youtube review talking fragrance x z far saddest part show individuality character self worth. people either realise chose turn blind eye greed brands. e.g. est e lauder purchased kilian brand flagship love shy still incredibly popular reformulated since acquisition incredibly potent however likely parfum doesnt last minutes. people saying leave ldbs sunlight turn liquid darker shade orange known already clearly reformulation course people would rather make feel better actually acknowledging ripped complete lunacy. popularity benefit brand customer. quality sufferer immensely result like current formulation br . used posse integrity smell like le half formulation smell like warm butter wisp salted molten sugar bed fir resin cedar topped saffron atop form gastronomy foam truly masterpiece lasted week even see oil concentration bottle perform like consistency water. actually pity people jump aboard bandwagon hope br fragrance meanwhile people claim holy grail consumerism cheapened scent everyone want love much simply everyone else say lot person raf another unsuspecting fragrance come along ravaged treated exact carelessness received. downvote till heart content personally find fragrance smoky quite masculine. surprised considered feminine side unisex. like others reminds incense definitely smoky slightly boozy room. think well formulated fragrance strong without overpowering certainly long lasting. definitely think would smell great men woman prefer unisex rather feminine fragrances. fell hype since social media. price sceptical ordered sample. smell like incense sticks. nothing nothing less. smell like pas oud store heavy smell merging one. ive realised ive surrounded smell everywhere everyone thought heavy user incense home burny spicy smell stuck clothes. ill give chance grow right hate smell like inside spice cabinet. sophisticated slightly cold airy luxurious. chanel generation. people love hate everyone talk admire fact. amazing

recognize something would actually wear want purchase still curious nonetheless. fortunately able find store nearby carried could sample first left little disappointed could smell medicinal bandaid quality people talk about. smell exactly like gritty pink tooth polish dentist use clean teeth last way entire duration. scent would feel like walking around smelling day lol funky scent aside say perfume quality well done tell smooth well blended perfume good longevity sillage. one lucky one work great would definitely recommend others try buy possible seems lot inconsistency among reviewer appear play nicely everyone. sometimes smell like hospital medicinal sometimes smell like sugar long day wear sometimes smell like sweat. definitely guarantee occasional dissappearing acts. like guy
